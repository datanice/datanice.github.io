    <p>Since Andrej Karpathy conviced me of the <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">The Unreasonable Effectiveness
of Recurrent Neural
Networks</a>, I
decided to give it a try as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As I was wondering in the Wiesn in Munich for the Oktoberfest, the beer
festival, I wondered how would a RNN write a beer review.</p>
<p><a href="https://datanice.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20150928_201119163.jpg"><img alt="IMG_20150928_201119163" src="https://datanice.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20150928_201119163.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>The beautiful thing about recurrent neural networks compared
with regular neural networks is that they keep a history of all the past
elements in a sequence in their hidden layers. They can be very
efficient at generating sequences like text or music <a href="http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/">Composing Music
With Recurrent Neural
Networks</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://karpathy.github.io/assets/rnn/charseq.jpeg" /></p>
<p>In the diagram above (from Andrej Karpathy blog post) , we see how the
different layers are linked to each other in the RNN. Note that to train
a Neural Network we can use a regular backpropagation algorithm
adjusting weights to increase the score of the desired output. For the
test phase, we feed each output to the next input to generate a text
sample.</p>
<p>I used the
<a href="https://github.com/gjreda/beer-snob-says/blob/master/sample.txt">data</a>
from Greg Reda repository, who created a beer review bot <a href="http://www.gregreda.com/2015/03/30/beer-review-markov-chains/">using Markov
Chains.</a>So
what do RNN think about beer ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The smell is creamy, malty and woody, not much presence. The taste is
dark fruits, and floral hops before its a strong destroy from the
mouth as it warms up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see that the vocabulary is not perfect, Here I'm using a hign
temperature which makes the RNN take greater risks but causes more
mistakes.</p>
<p>With a low temperature (0.3) we get the most frequent expressions, but
not too much innovation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pours a clear golden color with a thin head that dissipated quickly.
The smell is very sweet and sweet with a bit of citrus and a hint of
citrus. The taste is somewhat sweet and smokey with a light bitterness
to it. The body is light and creamy with a somewhat smooth finish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that we find a complete review :look, smell ,taste and body.
Sometimes I also encounter grades. The RNN has not only learnt to use
words and expressions but it has also learnt the layout of a beer review
!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouthfeel is good with a slightly sweet taste. The finish is sweet
and refreshing, and it was pretty good. I smell a bit of bitterness
and a crisp aftertaste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can also force the network to use some text at the beginning, we can
get some nice reviews :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This one reminds me of a porter. Pours a moderate copper colour, with
a malty straw color. Thick head that stays and left leaving no lacing.</p>
<p>This one is pretty nice. The carbonation is in the mouth, creamy and
pretty drinkable. The hops are the grainy and piney flavors even the
hops right off</p>
<p>One of my new large rum. I have got to sip a good brewery. It is by
the 2007 barrelard for a consume. Just no hoppiness for the point.</p>
<p>One of my favourite of all the weizen glass.Pours a bright straw color
with beige gold colored head of good carbonation. Plenty of lace.
Smell is caramel malt, and yeast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can go on for long with this... If you want to train your own RNN,
just use <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn">Andrej's Code on
Github</a>, he also made a <a href="https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086">simple
version in
numpy/python</a></p>
